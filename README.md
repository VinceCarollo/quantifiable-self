# Calorie Coacher
Calorie coacher is a calorie tracking/recipe app build in NodeJS. It consists of 3 main components.

- A microservice for getting recipes using the edamam API @ https://github.com/Patrick-Duvall/calorie-coacher-recipes
- **This app** which serves API endpoints for foods and meals. This app hits the microservice for some functionality and is hit by the below frontend.
- A frontend that hits both this app and the microservice to display data to a user https://github.com/VinceCarollo/calorie_coacher_fe
- Meal and food information is stored on the main app via a many-to-many. Recipes functionally have a many-to-many relationship with foods but we don't store this relation in the database. Rather in exists when our main service queries our microservice with a food type and we get back recipes containing this food type.

## Local Setup
To run this endpoint on your local machine first `git clone git@github.com:Patrick-Duvall/quantifiable-self.git`

- Next, `npm install` to update dependencies
- Once you're updated run `npm start` to spin up your sever locally
- Now, all of the documented endpoints should be available at `http://localhost:3000` You can hit them either in [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or in your browser by appending the endpoint i.e GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/recipes/search?calories=300 in Postman or by copy/pasting http://localhost:3000/api/v1/recipes/search?calories=300 into your browser window.

## End point Documentation

## Running Tests
Tests are written in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://chaijs.com/). The tests that hit the recipe microservice use the live, hosted microservice, which has its environmental variables configured to hit the Edamam API. As such, testing consists of running `npm test` to run the test suite. Make sure you've run `npm install` in the initial setup.
